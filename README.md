# Storywriting App

Users are able to login and write a story! Users write this story line by line. Multiple users can collaborate on the same story. Users are able to delete their lines when they want to start a new story. (Alternatively, this can be looked at as a poem maker too!)

## How It's Made:

Languages/frameworks use: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, MongoDB, Express

## Thoughts:

Definitely a lot of trouble shooting with this one. Initially had wanted to make a way to delete each individual line created...but it did cause more trouble than it was worth. Ended up scrapping that idea and only making a delete all feature. Would love to come back to this project and play around with that button more!
